# Project Title
MASAI CONNECT
## Introduction
Masai Connect - Pair Programming Sessions is a platform that enables students to book one-on-one coding sessions with instructors in real time. It displays available instructors, allows instant or scheduled bookings, and integrates Google Meet for seamless live collaboration. Students can share code, chat, and receive feedback during sessions, while instructors can manage availability and track performance. A dashboard helps both students and instructors track session history, feedback, and upcoming bookings. The system also includes gamification, session analytics, and role-based access for admins to monitor engagement. ðŸš€
